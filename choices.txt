1. The db describes file DBRresenter. It used singleton pattern for initializing, because I need only one file exeplar of base.
2. DBRecord describes one row of data from db.
3. DBPresenter can contais only Intereg.MAX_VALUE of DBRecords, because I use it as list and list can contains only 
Integer.MAX_VALUE of rows. I decided that 2^31-1 of rows is enough for realization.
4. By update, delete or add row to db the write to file is occur. Maybe it is not best realization but requirement not needed
perfect performance.
5. DBReaderWriter file reads and writes to the file.
6. For logging I used log4j (version 1.2.17) because it is simple, popular and rather fast.
